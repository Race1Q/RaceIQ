Drivers Page ‚Äî Automated Test Checklist

This checklist outlines the automated tests you have implemented for the Drivers page. All of these tests are running successfully and are an integral part of your continuous integration and development process.

Drivers.test.tsx

 Loading and Success State: The component shows a loading spinner initially and then successfully renders team tabs and driver cards after a successful API fetch.

 Filtering Functionality: Clicking a team tab correctly filters the displayed driver cards and updates the active tab's styling.

 Error Handling: When the API fetch fails, the component renders an error message and triggers a toast notification with the correct information.

 Empty State Handling: The component correctly renders a "No drivers found." message when the API returns an empty list of drivers.

Admin Page ‚Äî Automated Test Checklist

The Admin page is mostly static UI, so automated tests focus on structure and CSS class consistency.

Admin.test.tsx

 Main Title and Section: Renders the "Admin Dashboard" title and "System Overview" heading.

 Statistics Grid: Renders exactly 4 stat cards with the correct titles, values, and subtitles.

 Admin Tools: Renders the Quick Actions card with 3 action buttons: Refresh Data Cache, View System Logs, and Manage Users.

 Recent Activity: Renders the Recent Activity list with exactly 5 items.

 Admin Features: Renders the Admin Features section with one title and two description paragraphs, each using the correct adminFeaturesDescription class.

main.tsx ‚Äî Automated Test Checklist

Goal: Ensure the root entry correctly composes providers and renders without side effects.

main.test.tsx

 Renders Without Crashing: Rendering main.tsx bootstraps the app without throwing.

 Providers Wrap Correctly: Confirms the presence of provider effects (e.g., theme class on body, or a known element that only appears when providers mount).

 Auth0 Provider Config: Auth0Provider receives domain/clientId/audience from import.meta.env (or window.* on SWA).

 Router Boots: Root route renders expected content (e.g., landing hero, top nav).

 No Network on Boot: global.fetch is mocked; no unintended API calls run during initial mount.

 Responsive Determinism: window.matchMedia mocked to desktop to avoid layout-dependent flakiness.

 Portal Safety (If Used): Chakra portals (modals/toasts) render without error.

 Accessibility Baseline: First focusable element is reachable via Tab.

App.tsx ‚Äî Automated Test Checklist

Goal: Verify routing, top-level layout, auth-driven UI, and that gates/loaders don‚Äôt block the UI in tests.

App.test.tsx

 Unauthenticated Navbar: Navbar renders links Home, Drivers, Races, About.

 Login CTA Visible: When unauthenticated, at least one Log In button is visible.

 Hero Renders on Home: Hero heading and subtitle render on root route.

 Authenticated Navbar: When authenticated, navbar shows My Profile and Log Out.

 Route Mounting: Navigating to /drivers mounts the Drivers page.

 Responsive Stability: window.matchMedia mocked to desktop so nav isn‚Äôt hidden.

 Auth Gate Bypass: Role/onboarding gates are mocked to ready (no ‚Äúsetting up your account‚Äù blockers).

 Isolation: API services (f1ApiService) mocked to prevent real network calls.

 Accessible Queries: Tests rely on getByRole / findByRole selectors (no brittle queries).
