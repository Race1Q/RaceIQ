## Drivers Page ‚Äî Automated Test Checklist
This checklist outlines the automated tests you have implemented for the Drivers page. All of these tests are running successfully and are an integral part of your continuous integration and development process.

**Drivers.test.tsx**
- [x] **Loading and Success State**: The component shows a loading spinner initially and then successfully renders team tabs and driver cards after a successful API fetch.  
- [x] **Filtering Functionality**: Clicking a team tab correctly filters the displayed driver cards and updates the active tab's styling.  
- [x] **Error Handling**: When the API fetch fails, the component renders an error message and triggers a toast notification with the correct information.  
- [x] **Empty State Handling**: The component correctly renders a "No drivers found." message when the API returns an empty list of drivers.  

---

## Admin Page ‚Äî Automated Test Checklist
The Admin page is mostly static UI, so automated tests focus on structure and CSS class consistency.

**Admin.test.tsx**
- [x] **Main Title and Section**: Renders the "Admin Dashboard" title and "System Overview" heading.  
- [x] **Statistics Grid**: Renders exactly 4 stat cards with the correct titles, values, and subtitles.  
- [x] **Admin Tools**: Renders the Quick Actions card with 3 action buttons: *Refresh Data Cache*, *View System Logs*, and *Manage Users*.  
- [x] **Recent Activity**: Renders the Recent Activity list with exactly 5 items.  
- [x] **Admin Features**: Renders the Admin Features section with one title and two description paragraphs, each using the correct `adminFeaturesDescription` class.

## üõ°Ô∏è Auth0 Configuration

This project uses **Auth0** for authentication.

### Local Development
- Create a `.env` file in `frontend/` with:
  ```bash
  VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-tenant.us.auth0.com
  VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
  VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your-api-audience

main.tsx ‚Äî Automated Test Checklist

Goal: Ensure the root entry correctly composes providers and renders without side effects.

main.test.tsx (suggested)

 Renders Without Crashing: Rendering main.tsx bootstraps the app without throwing.

 Providers Wrap Correctly: Confirms the presence of provider effects (e.g., theme class on body, or a known element that only appears when providers mount).

 Auth0 Provider Config: Auth0Provider receives domain/clientId/audience from import.meta.env (or window.* on SWA) ‚Äî validated by spying the module or injecting env vars before render.

 Router Boots: Root route renders expected content (e.g., landing hero, top nav).

 No Network on Boot: global.fetch is mocked; no unintended API calls run during initial mount.

 Responsive Determinism: window.matchMedia mocked to desktop to avoid layout-dependent flakiness.

 Portal Safety (If Used): If Chakra/portals are used globally, a portal container is present or mocked so modals/toasts don‚Äôt error.

 Accessibility Baseline: The first focusable element is reachable via Tab (smoke check using Testing Library focus utilities if desired).

Minimal smoke-test strategy:

Render main.tsx (or a Root component exported for testing) inside a JSDOM container.

Assert the app‚Äôs top-level landmark (e.g., role="banner" or a known heading) appears and no console errors are emitted.

App.tsx ‚Äî Automated Test Checklist

Goal: Verify routing, top-level layout, auth-driven UI, and that gates/loaders don‚Äôt block the UI in tests.

App.test.tsx

 Unauthenticated Navbar: Navbar renders accessible links: Home, Drivers, Races, About.

 Login CTA Visible: When unauthenticated, at least one Log In button is present (navbar and/or hero).

 Hero Renders on Home: Home hero header renders (title + subtitle).

 Authenticated Navbar: When authenticated, navbar shows My Profile and Log Out (as button or link).

 Route Mounting: Navigating to /drivers mounts the Drivers page (assert via stable heading/nav active link).

 Responsive Stability: window.matchMedia is mocked to desktop so the nav isn‚Äôt hidden/collapsed in tests.

 Auth Gate Bypass: Any role/onboarding ‚Äúsetup‚Äù gate is mocked to ready (e.g., RoleContext mocked, fetch stubbed) so tests remain deterministic.

 Isolation: No real network access; services (e.g., f1ApiService.getRecentRaces) are mocked.

 Accessible Queries: Tests use getByRole/findByRole on visible controls; no brittle querySelector/class-based lookups.

Notes:

If the app uses a non-semantic container for nav, tests scope queries to a fallback container (e.g., role="banner" or document.body) rather than requiring <nav>.

jest-dom matchers are registered via expect.extend(matchers) (Vitest-compatible).
