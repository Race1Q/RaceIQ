# üö® Security Incident Response - Google API Key Exposure

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Issue:** Google Gemini API key was exposed in public repository
**Status:** CRITICAL - Immediate action required

---

## What Happened

Your Google Gemini API key (``) was hardcoded in documentation files that were committed to your public GitHub repository. This caused:

1. **Automated bots** to scan and find the exposed key
2. **Unauthorized usage** of your API key by third parties
3. **Google's policy violation** alert and service restriction

**Files that contained the exposed key:**
- `backend/DEPLOYMENT-AI.md` (line 24)
- `backend/PRODUCTION-READY-CHANGES.md` (line 61)

---

## ‚úÖ Immediate Actions (DO THESE NOW)

### Step 1: Revoke the Compromised API Key (5 minutes)

1. Go to **Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Credentials**
3. Find the project **"RaceIQ"** (ID: `gen-lang-client-0740065087`)
4. Locate your API key that starts with ``
5. Click on the key and select **"Delete"** or **"Regenerate"**
6. Confirm deletion

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO THIS IMMEDIATELY** - Every minute the key remains active, it can be abused.

---

### Step 2: Generate a New API Key (5 minutes)

1. In the same **Google Cloud Console** ‚Üí **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Credentials**
2. Click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"** ‚Üí **API key**
3. Copy the new API key immediately
4. **IMPORTANT:** Click **"Restrict Key"** and configure:
   - **Application restrictions:** Select "HTTP referrers" or "IP addresses" to limit where it can be used
   - **API restrictions:** Select only "Generative Language API"
   - Set a **quota limit** if available to prevent abuse
5. Save restrictions

---

### Step 3: Update Your Environment Variables (10 minutes)

#### For Local Development:

1. Update your local `.env` file (in `backend/.env`):
   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
   ```

2. **NEVER commit `.env` files to Git** (they're already in `.gitignore`, but verify)

#### For Render (Production Backend):

1. Go to your **Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Select your backend service
3. Navigate to **Environment** tab
4. Find `GEMINI_API_KEY` and click **Edit**
5. Replace with your new API key
6. Click **Save Changes** (this will trigger a redeploy)

---

### Step 4: Commit the Fixed Documentation Files (5 minutes)

The exposed API keys have been removed from the documentation files and replaced with placeholders. Now commit these changes:

```bash
git add backend/DEPLOYMENT-AI.md backend/PRODUCTION-READY-CHANGES.md
git commit -m "security: Remove exposed API key from documentation"
git push origin main
```

---

### Step 5: Submit an Appeal to Google (10 minutes)

1. Visit the **Appeals Page**: https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_compliance
   - Make sure you're logged in as the **project owner**

2. **Write your appeal** (use this template):

   ```
   Subject: Appeal for Project RaceIQ (gen-lang-client-0740065087) - API Key Exposure

   Dear Google Cloud Trust & Safety Team,

   I am writing to appeal the restriction placed on my project "RaceIQ" (ID: gen-lang-client-0740065087).

   EXPLANATION OF VIOLATION:
   I inadvertently committed a Gemini API key to a public GitHub repository in documentation files. This was a security mistake on my part, and I was not aware the key was exposed until receiving your notification.

   CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN:
   1. Immediately revoked the compromised API key (AIzaSy...as3fU)
   2. Generated a new API key with proper restrictions (IP/referrer restrictions + API-specific restrictions)
   3. Removed the exposed key from all documentation files
   4. Committed the fixes to the repository
   5. Updated all production environment variables with the new, secured key
   6. Implemented additional security measures to prevent future exposure

   FUTURE PREVENTION:
   - All API keys are now stored exclusively in environment variables (.env files)
   - .env files are in .gitignore and will never be committed
   - Documentation files now use placeholder text only
   - Implemented pre-commit hooks to scan for exposed secrets
   - Team has been educated on API key security best practices

   I understand the severity of this security issue and have taken immediate steps to resolve it. The unauthorized usage was not intentional, and I have implemented measures to ensure this never happens again.

   Thank you for your consideration.

   Best regards,
   [Your Name]
   ```

3. Submit the appeal and **wait for Google's response** (usually 1-3 business days)

## üîí Long-Term Security Improvements

### 1. Add Pre-Commit Hook to Detect Secrets

Install `git-secrets` or similar tool:

```bash
# Install git-secrets (Windows/Mac/Linux)
npm install -g git-secrets

# Initialize in your repo
cd /path/to/RaceIQ
git secrets --install
git secrets --register-aws  # Detects AWS-like patterns
git secrets --add 'AIza[0-9A-Za-z_-]{35}'  # Detect Google API keys
```

### 2. Use Environment Variable Validation

In your backend, add validation to ensure keys are loaded from environment only:

```typescript
// backend/src/main.ts or app.module.ts
if (!process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY) {
  throw new Error('GEMINI_API_KEY must be set in environment variables');
}
```

### 3. Regular Security Audits

- Use GitHub's **Dependabot** to scan for exposed secrets
- Enable **secret scanning** in your GitHub repository settings
- Rotate API keys every 90 days as a best practice

### 4. Repository Security (If Public)

Consider if your repository needs to be public:
- If it's for a school project, consider making it **private** during development
- Use **GitHub's secret scanning** feature (enabled by default for public repos)
- Add a `SECURITY.md` file with security policies

## üìä Monitoring Post-Incident

After completing the above steps, monitor:

1. **Google Cloud Console** ‚Üí **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Enabled APIs**
   - Check the **Quota** usage for Generative Language API
   - Set up alerts for unusual spikes

2. **Render Logs** (if using Render for backend)
   - Check for any failed API calls due to the old key

3. **GitHub Security Alerts**
   - Go to your repo ‚Üí **Security** tab
   - Review any alerts or recommendations

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: How did Google find out?
**A:** Google scans public repositories (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) for exposed API keys. When found, they track usage and flag projects with policy violations.

### Q: Will I lose my project permanently?
**A:** Likely not, if you:
- Act quickly to revoke the key
- Submit a detailed appeal showing corrective actions
- Demonstrate you understand the issue and won't repeat it

### Q: Can I get a new Google Cloud project?
**A:** Yes, but:
- Your current project should be restored after a successful appeal
- Creating a new project is an option, but the restriction might follow your account

### Q: How do I know the new key is secure?
**A:** 
- It should only be in `.env` files (which are gitignored)
- Never commit environment files to Git
- Use API restrictions to limit where the key can be used
