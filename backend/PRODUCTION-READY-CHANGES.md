# Production-Ready Changes Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Changed

### 1. Updated Cache Path for Azure Deployment

**File:** `backend/src/ai/cache/persistent-cache.service.ts`

**Change:**

```typescript
// BEFORE (only worked locally):
private readonly cacheDir = join(process.cwd(), '.cache');

// AFTER (works locally AND on Azure):
private readonly cacheDir = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? join('/home', '.cache')  // Azure persistent storage
  : join(process.cwd(), '.cache');  // Local development
```

**Why:**

- Azure App Service provides persistent storage at `/home/*`
- `process.cwd()` points to ephemeral container storage that gets wiped on redeploys
- This change ensures your cache survives restarts and redeployments

---

## üöÄ How It Works

### Local Development (Your Machine)

```
Environment: NODE_ENV = development (or undefined)
Cache Path: ./backend/.cache/ai-cache.json
Persistence: Saved to your local disk
Git: Ignored (in .gitignore)
```

### Production (Azure App Service)

```
Environment: NODE_ENV = production
Cache Path: /home/.cache/ai-cache.json
Persistence: Azure persistent storage (survives redeploys!)
Shared: All users share the same cache
```

---

## üìã What You Need to Do for Deployment

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Azure

Go to **Azure Portal** ‚Üí Your App Service ‚Üí **Configuration** ‚Üí **Application settings**

Add these **6 required AI variables**:

```bash
AI_FEATURES_ENABLED=true
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyD-dx7VhoB49SeksKCd4u8BnFYQ17as3fU
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp
AI_NEWS_TTL_MIN=60
AI_BIO_TTL_H=48
AI_TRACK_TTL_H=24
```

**IMPORTANT:** Also ensure `NODE_ENV=production` is set!

### Step 2: Deploy Your Code

```bash
# Commit changes (make sure .env is NOT committed!)
git add .
git commit -m "Add production-ready AI features with persistent caching"
git push origin main
```

Azure will auto-deploy if configured.

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

After deployment, check:

```bash
# Test quota endpoint
curl https://your-app.azurewebsites.net/api/ai/quota

# Test news endpoint
curl https://your-app.azurewebsites.net/api/ai/news

# Test driver bio
curl https://your-app.azurewebsites.net/api/ai/driver/609/bio
```

## üéØ Benefits of This Change

### Before (Not Production-Ready):

‚ùå Cache stored in container's working directory  
‚ùå Cache lost on every redeploy  
‚ùå Every deployment = fresh start = more API calls  
‚ùå Wastes your free tier quota

### After (Production-Ready):

‚úÖ Cache stored in Azure persistent storage  
‚úÖ Cache survives redeploys and restarts  
‚úÖ Minimal API calls (only when cache expires)  
‚úÖ Maximizes free tier efficiency  
‚úÖ Faster response times for users

---

## üìä Cache Behavior Examples

### Scenario: Deploy New Backend Version

**Before this change:**

```
1. Deploy new version ‚Üí Container rebuilds
2. Cache is lost
3. First user requests news ‚Üí API call to Gemini
4. Next 100 users ‚Üí All hit API (cache was wiped!)
= 100+ API calls
```

**After this change:**

```
1. Deploy new version ‚Üí Container rebuilds
2. Cache persists at /home/.cache/
3. First user requests news ‚Üí Cache HIT (no API call!)
4. Next 100 users ‚Üí All get cached response
= 0 API calls!
```

### Scenario: App Restart (Azure maintenance, etc.)

**Before this change:**

```
App restarts ‚Üí Cache lost ‚Üí Fresh API calls needed
```

**After this change:**

```
App restarts ‚Üí Cache loaded from /home/.cache/ ‚Üí No API calls needed
```

---

## üîç Verifying the Cache in Production

### Option 1: Check Logs

After deployment, look for this in Azure App Service ‚Üí Log stream:

```
[PersistentCacheService] Loaded 5 cached AI responses from disk (0 expired entries skipped)
[GeminiService] Gemini service initialized with model: gemini-2.0-flash-exp
```

If you see "Loaded X cached AI responses", it's working! ‚úÖ

### Option 2: SSH into Azure Container

Azure Portal ‚Üí Your App Service ‚Üí **SSH** ‚Üí Execute:

```bash
ls -la /home/.cache/
cat /home/.cache/ai-cache.json
```

You should see your cache file with AI responses!

### Option 3: Test Response Times

```bash
# First request (might be cached from previous session)
time curl https://your-app.azurewebsites.net/api/ai/news

# Second request (should be FAST - cached)
time curl https://your-app.azurewebsites.net/api/ai/news
```

If second request is < 200ms, cache is working! üéâ

## üö® Important Notes

### 1. NODE_ENV Must Be Set

The cache path selection depends on `NODE_ENV`:

```typescript
process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? '/home/.cache' // Azure
  : '.cache'; // Local
```

**Make sure** you have this in Azure Application Settings:

```
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 2. Don't Commit .env Files

Your `.gitignore` already includes:

```
.env
.env.*
.cache/
```

Keep it that way! API keys should never be in Git.

### 3. Cache is Shared Across All Users

This is intentional and good:

- ‚úÖ News is the same for everyone
- ‚úÖ Driver bios are the same for everyone
- ‚úÖ Track previews are the same for everyone

One user's request benefits all subsequent users!

### 4. Manual Cache Clear (if needed)

If you ever need to force fresh AI content:

**Option A:** Delete via SSH:

```bash
rm /home/.cache/ai-cache.json
```

**Option B:** Create an admin endpoint:

```typescript
@Delete('cache/clear')
async clearCache() {
  await this.cacheService.clear();
  return { message: 'Cache cleared successfully' };
}
```

## üìà Expected Production Performance

### First Request (Cache Miss):

- Response time: 2-5 seconds
- Gemini API call: Yes (1 call)
- Logged: `Cache MISS: news:f1`

### Subsequent Requests (Cache Hit):

- Response time: 50-150ms
- Gemini API call: No
- Logged: `Cache HIT: news:f1`

### Daily API Usage:

- News: ~24 calls/day (60 min TTL)
- Driver Bios: ~10 calls/day (48 hour TTL)
- Track Previews: ~10 calls/day (24 hour TTL)
- **Total: ~44 calls/day = 3% of free tier**
